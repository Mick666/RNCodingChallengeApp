Notes on packages used:
    -   React-Native-Dotenv
        - Included to enable environmental variables and avoid uploading the API key to a public Github repo

Notes on the completed app:
    -   A .env file will be required for the app to run, this will be attached in the email this repo is linked in.
    -   The API output includes some formatting errors (missing values, malformatted text), which the app tries to correct for where possible.
